# Substitutions
Substitutions are placeholders in _Expressions_ for values that will not be known until runtime. They include _Captures_ that were captured in the _Match_ part of a statement, as well as _Globals_.

Syntactically, a Substitution always starts with a `$` and is followed by an _Identifier_

_Globals_ and _Captures_ have the same syntax and are used in the same positions. In order to prevent a name collision, it is recommended that globals use $UPPER_CASE_SNAKE_CASE, and _Captures_ use $lowerCamelCase.

In the event that a _Global_ and _Capture_ do have a name collision, the _Capture_ will take precedence.

```
# These are all valid globals conforming convention:
$GAS_PRICE
$ENABLE_SURGE_PRICING
$AVG_RESPONSE_BYTES

# And these are all valid captures conforming to convention:
$first
$skip

# This is a When Clause that uses a substitution
when $skip > 1000

# And this is a Cost expression using substitutions
(500 + $skip) * $AVG_TIME
```

If the value of a _Substitution_ cannot be found, the _Statement_ will return an error and the query will not be costed. This can be used to ban problematic or unknown queries, if desired.

```
# A statement preventing matching queries from being costed
query { problem } => $_BAN_;
```


## Globals
A global is a value that is supplied at runtime from outside of the cost model. This enables making efficient incremental changes to a cost model in response to market conditions, traffic spikes, and the like.

## Captures
Captures are covered in more detail in [Matches](./matches.md).

## Type Coercion
The following coercions are supported:

### Converting to bool
    null => false
    int => int != 0
    string => string.len() != 0
    list => list.len() != 0
    object => true

### Converting to rational
    true => 1
    false => 0
    null => 0
    string => parseInt(string)

If the coercion fails, the pricing will return an error and the query will not be costed.
