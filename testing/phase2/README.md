# Phase 2 Testing

The script in this directory provides a basic way of testing the health of an
indexer. Note: This test is _not_ comprehensive, it just gives you a general
idea of where things may be bad.

## Usage

Install dependencies with:

```bash
yarn
```

Run the script with:

```bash
./phase2-test indexer <indexer-address>
```
